# Visual Style Guide for Website Redesign

This document outlines the visual direction for the new website, based on the provided reference images.

## Key Visual Elements:

### 1. Hero Section:
- **Layout:** Full-screen.
- **Background:** A video will play in the background, creating an immersive experience. The video should be high-quality and relevant to the brand's message (refer to the first screenshot for the general feel of a full-screen, impactful visual).
- **Typography:** Prominent, large typography for the main headline, as seen in the first screenshot ("Websites and branding for eco-conscious companies").
- **Call to Action:** Clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Get started", "View our work") should be present, similar to the first screenshot.

### 2. Subsequent Content Sections (e.g., "Is your website & branding limiting your impact?"):
- **Layout:** Follow the structural and content layout similar to the second screenshot.
- **Background:** Unlike the hero, these sections will have a clean, solid background (the video hero replaces the watery background aesthetic seen in the example).
- **Typography:** Continue the use of large, clear typography for headings and body text. The style should be clean and highly readable.
- **Imagery/Media:** Incorporate images or visual elements thoughtfully, as shown with the "Featured project" card in the second screenshot.

### 3. Overall Aesthetic:
- **Design:** Clean, minimal, and modern.
- **Typography Focus:** Emphasis on large, impactful typography throughout the site to convey messages clearly and create a strong visual hierarchy.
- **Color Palette:** (To be defined, but should complement the clean and minimal style. The examples use a mix of dark text on light backgrounds and light text on dark image overlays).
- **Spacing:** Generous use of whitespace to ensure a decluttered and focused user experience.

This rule should guide design and development decisions to ensure a cohesive and impactful visual identity for the new website.
